# Python Data Analysis with Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

* I have been studying Python for Data Analysis. For Data Analysis, I have used **Numpy** and **Pandas**. And for Data Visualization, I have used **Matplotlib**.

* I have taken a course <Python for Machine Learning> during 2018 summer vacation. This course was developed by Prof. Sung-Chul Choi at **NAVER edwith**. [THIS](https://www.edwith.org/aipython) is the link of course.
